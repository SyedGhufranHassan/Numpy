# Numpy
Welcome to the NumPy repository, the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. NumPy is a powerful library that supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.

Features:

Multidimensional Arrays: At the core of NumPy is the ndarray, an n-dimensional array object that facilitates the creation and manipulation of numerical data.
Mathematical Functions: NumPy includes numerous functions for performing mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more on arrays.
Broadcasting: Simplify the code by allowing arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes.
Indexing and Slicing: Access and modify array elements efficiently with powerful indexing and slicing capabilities.
Linear Algebra: Perform complex linear algebra operations including dot products, matrix decompositions, and more.
Random Sampling: Generate random numbers and arrays using the robust random number generation functions.
